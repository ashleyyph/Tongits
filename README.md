# Creative Labs | Spring 2019

### Introduction
Last spring, my close friend Henry and I decided we wanted to lead a project for Creative Labs, an organization at UCLA that seeks to empower students and build community on campus through collaborative innovation. We submitted a proposal detailing our idea of developing an app to support digital bullet journaling, a former hobby of mine that I'd ceased due to a lack of time and money for stationary. We received an interview from the executive directors and passionately pitched our idea to them. 

They reached out to us a few days later and told us they'd love for us to lead a project! Unfortunately, they weren't big fans of our idea as several journal-related projects had already been done that year. So, they asked us to come up with something new despite pitch day happening in less than 48 hours.

Henry and I scrambled to come up with something. Some of our ideas, like a Pinterest-esque app focused solely on recipes, seemed great at first but ultimately seemed to have too large of a scope given the ~8 week timeline for most projects. As pitch day approached, an idea suddenly popped into my mind. 

One of our friend group's favorite games to play was a card game by the name of Tongits. A Filipino friend taught us the game a few months prior, and its fast-paced nature combined with the luck and strategy necessary to win made it pretty addictive. Though we all loved the game, we weren't always free to play with one another. So, I suggested that we digitize the game with a single player mode, and that we should incorporate culturally relevant graphics (since many of our friends were very involved in the Southeast Asian space at UCLA, and I personally had a passion for culture-related design work). Just like that, our project (Tongits) was born!

### Competitor Analysis
We began our project by researching existing Tongits games on the App Store. Our research revealed three key findings:
* Competitors have a clunky interface, which can cause confusion during gameplay
* Competitors have an outdated design, which makes gameplay feel less engaging
* Competitors have a standard design, which fails to highlight the Filipino origin of the game

### Design Process
After we identified key painpoints users might experience with existing Tongits games, we began the design process for our game. Through weekly meetings involving extensive discussion of the interface design and many whiteboard sketches, we constructed an ideal setup interface for the game. After a few more discussions, we realized our design was also quite cluttered and decided that we should limit showing cards unnecessarily.
